# pathfinder_2D
This is a simulation project where I used my custom robot, Pathfinder for mapping and autonomous navigation using Robot Operating System (ROS). 
In this repo, we will explore only the 2D aspects such as 2D GMapping. I wil make a separate repository for 3D mapping and navvigation. Stay tuned.
